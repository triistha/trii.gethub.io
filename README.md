## Introduction  
The analysis is done for partial fulfillment of Evidence-Based Business Analytics course offered for students enrolled in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at [**Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)**](https://som.ku.edu.np/). For the analysis, a dataset named [*World Population Data*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset) was selected from Kaggle.

## Analysis

Above chart highlights the distribution of employees as per their role in the organization. We can infer that among the employees most of the employees are working as Sales executives followed by Research Scientist, Laboratory Technician, Manufacturing Director, Healthcare representative and so on.

Most of the employees of the organization i.e. 998 travel rarely for business purposes. Meanwhile 270 employees travel frequently for business purposes while 148 employees have not traveled at all for business purposes. Similarly, most of the employees are educated in Life sciences (41.18%) followed by Medical (31.31%), Marketing (10.89%), Technical degree (9.07%), Other (5.69%) and Human resources (1.83%).

The employees attrition is at 16.16% meaning that among the total employees 16.16% have left the job.Likewise we can observe that among the employees only about 1/3rd of the employees work overtime. Similarly, most of the employees (721) working in the organization earn upto $5k per month, followed by employees (428) earning between $5k-$10k. 144 employees earn between $10k-$15k with only 130 employees earning more than $15k per month.  

#### Research Questions
The question which we are trying to answer through the analysis includes the followings:  
* Which age group has the highest attrition?
* Does distance from home impact employee attrition rate?
* Does salary determine attrition among employees?
* Do years since the last promotion trigger attrition among employees?
* Does salary increase (%) affect employee attrition?
* Does the education field determine monthly salary?
* Does monthly income determine attrition?

The highest number of employee attrition in terms of absolute number is seen in the age group 26-35 years. But if we see with a close eye, we can see that the highest rate of employee attrition is seen in the age group 18-25 where almost half of the employees were leaving the job. Likewise we also found that the highest attrition among employees due to distance from home ranges between 0 km and 4km. A second spike in attrition is seen when an employees house is at a distance of 8-10 km and a third spike is seen when the employees house is at a distance of 23-25 km.

The chart signals that there is a higher case of employee attrition between years 0-4 of an employees recent promotion. As the years since promotion progresses, the attrition rate decreases. This is quite contrary to general understanding in which it is accepted that if employees go without promotion for a long time they tend to leave the organization. We can infer through the bar chart that the owerthe pay the higher the employee attrition rate. As can be seen the highest attrition is seen in the salary slab upto 5k while salary slab above 15k has the lowest attrition signaling that if employees are paid higher they tend to have lower attrition.  

![main chart_page-0007](https://github.com/koirala99/Pair-Project/assets/38663887/0ae00158-f7b8-4ed8-8199-aaa6258fd5d6)   
The employee attrition and monthly income chart shows that on an average the employees who are leaving the organization have below $5000 in monthly income while those staying in the organization have at least $6500 monthly income. Likewise the monthly income as per education field shows that the highest earning field on an average is Marketing ($7353.64), followed by Human Resources ($7275.54), Medical ($6540.83), Life Sciences ($6527.97), Other ($5783.88) and at last Technical degree ($5749.12). Similarly the chart employee attrition and salary hike (%) showed that employees who have an annual salary hike of less than 15% have the highest attrition rate. This further corroborates with the result seen in chart above signaling that lower pay and lower pay growth leads to increased employee attrition.  

## Findings  
The major findings from the analysis are as follows:
* Employees between the age group 26-35 have the highest attrition count in absolute terms while the age group 18-25 has the highest attrition rate.
* Employees living near the organization have the highest attrition rate. 
* Employees that got promoted in the past 4 years have the highest attrition rate. 
* Employees earning in the income slab of Upto 5k have the highest attrition rate while employees earning in the income slab of 15k+ have the lowest attrition rate. 
* On an average, employees earning less than $4500 have the highest attrition rate while employees earning higher than $6500 have reduced attrition. 
* Employees who have yearly salary growth of less than 15% have the highest attrition rate.
* Employees having a Marketing education background have the highest monthly pay followed by Human resources while employees with Technical Degree have the lowest monthly pay. 

## Practical implications
The implications that managers and executives can make to reduce employee attrition in their organization includes the following:  
* Focus on retention strategies for employees aged 26-35, such as career development and work-life balance initiatives.
* Enhance the workplace experience for employees living near the organization through commuter benefits and nearby amenities.
* Review promotion policies to provide adequate support and development opportunities for newly promoted employees.
* Ensure competitive salaries and merit-based increases to retain talent, particularly for those earning below $4500 and experiencing slower salary growth.
* Address pay disparities based on educational background and invest in professional development to bridge gaps and retain technical talent.

## Conclusion  
In conclusion, the analysis conducted yielded valuable insights into employee demographics, characteristics, and factors influencing attrition. Leveraging the HR Analytics Dataset from Kaggle, thorough data cleaning and visualization using Power Query and Power BI respectively, enabled a comprehensive understanding of the organizational workforce.  

Key findings highlighted significant correlations between various factors and employee attrition. Notably, employees aged 26-35 exhibited the highest attrition count, while those aged 18-25 had the highest attrition rate. Additionally, proximity to the workplace, recent promotions, lower salaries, slower salary growth, and educational background were identified as contributors to attrition.  

These findings offer actionable implications for managers and executives aimed at mitigating attrition and fostering a more stable and engaged workforce. Strategies such as targeted retention efforts for specific age groups, improving the workplace experience for local employees, revising promotion policies, ensuring competitive compensation, and addressing pay disparities based on education can effectively reduce attrition rates.  

By incorporating these insights into organizational decision-making processes, businesses can proactively address attrition challenges, enhance employee satisfaction and retention, and ultimately improve overall organizational performance and stability.
